Pointer:- It is a special variable which stores the address/memory locations of
any variable.

int num1=10; //Declaration of num1 integer variable
char ch; //Declaration of ch character variable
int *iptr; //Declaration of pointer to integer
char *chptr; //Declaration of pointer to character
iptr=&num1; //Store the address of num1 variable in pointer iptr
chptr=&ch; //Store the address of ch variable in pointer chptr

n1=10
n2=5

n1=5
n2=10

temp=n1;//temp=10
n1=n2; //n1=5
n2=temp; //n2=10
